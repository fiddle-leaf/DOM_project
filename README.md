# Outfit Builder DOM Project
The program will take input from user: name and favorite color (togggles layout's color) and choice of items and color (from selection): 
- tops (short-sleeve, long-sleeve, and tank top)
- bottoms (pants, skirt, or shorts) 
- shoes (sneakers, sandals, or boots)
- if dress is selected => automatically skip tops and bottoms; 
- add option for accessories 

## Motivation
I like the idea of story-building from small exerts of information. I want to make it interactive and fun. The website will have a game feel but it will all be text-based (while manipulating the DOM).

## Languages
HTML/CSS and JavaScript

## How to Use: page link


## Credits
- [normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) for consistent formatting

## Bugs
- stop propagation of multiple items in the same catergory when changing selection (items get added into array)
- changing the item color from selection (maybe implement another type of graphic like unicode or add css filter property)
- add message for requiring User's name before submitting
