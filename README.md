# Username DOM Project
The program will take input from user: name, DOB, color, word, and number and return a username (plus data entered).

## Motivation
I like the idea of story-building from small exerts of information. I want to make it interactive and fun. The website will have a game feel but it will all be text-based (while manipulating the DOM).

## Languages
HTML/CSS and JavaScript

## How to Use: page link
