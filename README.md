# Outfit Builder DOM Project
The program will take input from user: name and favorite color (togggles layout's color) and choice of items and color (from selection): 
- tops (short-sleeve, long-sleeve, and tank top)
- bottoms (pants, skirt, or shorts) 
- shoes (sneakers, sandals, or boots)
- if dress is selected => automatically skip tops and bottoms; 
- add option for accessories 

## Motivation
I like the idea of story-building from small exerts of information. I want to make it interactive and fun. The website will have a game feel but it will all be text-based (while manipulating the DOM).

## Languages
HTML/CSS and JavaScript

## How to Use: page link
